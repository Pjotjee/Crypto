JAVA styleguide

Based on the following:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

Some extra agreements:
* TAB IS 4 SPACES
* In the else statements: the closing brace has its own line
* Docstring at the beginning of the class /*   */ and after that just line comments in the code using the // format
* no need to comment on variables like String name //bla bla bla
